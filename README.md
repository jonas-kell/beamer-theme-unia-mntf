# Beamer Theme: uniamntf

A theme for the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) package [beamer](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer) that replicates the look of the Powerpoint-Presentation template published by and for Augsburg University.

The template attempts to provide the basics features that the author needed to properly replicate the look of [This presentation template](#TODO) provided by Augsburg University.

## Usage

Replicate the `example-presentation.tex` and adapt to your needs.

LaTeX must be able to find the `.sty` files. This could be achieved by placing them right next to your main `.tex`-file.

The images must be located at the correct place. This could be achieved by placing the `slide-background-images`-folder right next to your main `.tex`-file.

## License

The images in the folder `slide-background-images` are not owned by the author of the template, but by Augsburg University.

Providing them here in this repository under the GPL license is assumed to be allowed.

As [per Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Logo_uni_augsburg.jpg), the logos may be distributed under GPL license (checked on 08.04.2024).
